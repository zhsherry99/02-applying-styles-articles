## Prompt 1
Create the HTML structure for an articles page consisting of a title, a featured article at the top, and two additional articles. Each post should display a title, a metadata list, a short description, and a 'Read More' link. Add a section at the bottom listing links to 'More Articles'.

Apply a minimalistic, modern style to the page using common CSS selectors (ID, type, class, etc.):
  * Use neutral or light colors for the background and text
  * Give the featured article a distinct look so it stands out
  * Ensure both regular articles share consistent spacing and a subtle style that doesn’t overshadow the featured post
  * Style the metadata so the items appear on one line
  * Keep headings easy to read and paragraphs well-spaced
  * Add a simple, modern font for the whole page
